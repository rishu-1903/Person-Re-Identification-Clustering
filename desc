description of the project

This project focuses on automatically clustering images of the same individual from a dataset captured in diverse real-world conditions. It enables search-and-retrieval, allowing users to input a query image and retrieve all matching images.

🚀 Key Features
🔹 Person Clustering: Groups images of the same individual across the dataset using deep learning and feature extraction.
🔹 Search & Retrieval: Users can input a query image, and the system retrieves all images of the same person.
🔹 Attribute Extraction: Identifies person-level attributes such as clothing color, accessories, and gender.
🔹 Data Visualization: Displays the dataset in 2D/3D space with cluster-based representations for better understanding.

🔧 Tech Stack
✅ Deep Learning (CNN, Transformer-based models)
✅ OpenCV for image processing
✅ FAISS/Scikit-learn for clustering & retrieval
✅ Matplotlib & Plotly for visualization

📌 How It Works
1️⃣ Extracts deep feature embeddings from images.
2️⃣ Clusters images of the same person using unsupervised learning.
3️⃣ Enables search-based retrieval by matching query images with the closest cluster.
4️⃣ Provides attribute-based filtering for refined search results.
5️⃣ Visualizes clusters and dataset distribution.

📜 Next Steps
 Improve clustering accuracy with self-supervised learning.
 Enhance retrieval performance using hybrid embedding techniques.
 Optimize real-time query response time.
